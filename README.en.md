## Welcome!

This is the source code of the official webpage for the project **"A Drop of Water, a Life"** by the Meteorology - Astronomy Club of the 1st Experimental Junior High School of Larissa, created as part of the **Climate Detectives** program.

The project focuses on analyzing the consequences of the **Daniel** storm that impacted Thessaly, while gathering broader information about this devastating event. We are proud to announce that our project won the **3rd prize nationally**!
